# Summary

According to the concordance cosmological theory, structure
formation and evolution proceeds hierarchically in the Universe.
Smaller-scale dark matter structures gravitationally collapse first
everywhere in the Universe, then merge into larger-scale structures.
Such dense gravitationally bound structures of dark matter are called
halos.  Halos can host smaller halos, so-called subhalos (or
substructures).  Cosmological $N$-body simulations are vital in
understanding the formation and evolution of halos and subhalos.
Halo/subhalo finders are a post-processing step to identify those dense
structures in the particle dataset of cosmological $N$-body
simulations.

MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder
based on the [Rockstar](https://bitbucket.org/gfcstanford/rockstar/)
phase-space temporal halo finder code [@Behroozi2013], which is one of
the most extensively used halo finding codes.  Compared to the
original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication
library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP,
which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory
environments of modern supercomputers.  This implementation can easily
handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than
100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset
for the next generation of cosmological surveys.

# Statement of need 

Owing to the advance of supercomputing power and highly scalable
parallel gravitational $N$-body codes [@Ishiyama2009b; @Ishiyama2012;
@Potter2017; @Wang2018; @Garrison2021], the number of particles in
recent massive cosmological simulations exceeds a trillion
[@Potter2017; @Ishiyama2021; @Wang2022], posing significant challenges
for halo finding.  Several halo finding algorithms have been
suggested [@Knebe2013], and some of their implementation are publicly
available [@Knollmann2009; @Behroozi2013; @Elahi2019; @Springel2021].
The computational performance of these implementations differs substantially,
and they have not been uniformly tested yet on the large-scale hybrid shared and distributed
memory environments of modern supercomputers.  MPI-Rockstar addresses
these issues and is designed to run on more than 100,000 parallel
processes in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP.  As new functions to
the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can
output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.
